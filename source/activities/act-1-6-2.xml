      A potato is placed in an oven whose temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and the potato's temperature <m>F</m> (in degrees Fahrenheit) is recorded in <xref ref="table-1-act-1-6-2">Table</xref>.

            What is the meaning of the value of <m>F''(30)</m> that you have computed in (b) in terms of the potato's temperature?
            Write several careful sentences that describe the overall behavior of the potato's temperature at this point in time. In particular, you should cite the values of <m>F(30)</m>, <m>F'(30)</m>, and <m>F''(30)</m>, each with appropriate units.

            At the moment <m>t = 30</m>,
            the temperature of the potato is <m>167.6</m> degrees;
            its temperature is rising at an instaneous rate of <m>2.605</m> degrees Fahrenheit per minute;
            and the rate at which the temperature is rising is <em>falling</em>
            at a rate of <m>0.0516</m> degrees Fahrenheit per minute per minute.  Over the minute from <m>t = 30</m> to <m>t = 31</m>,
            we expect the temperature of the potato to rise about <m>2.605</m> degrees Fahrenheit and for the rate at which its temperature is increasing to drop by about <m>0.0516</m> degrees Fahrenheit per minute.  We expect that <m>F(31) \approx 169.7</m> degrees Fahrenheit, and <m>F'(31) \approx 2.01343</m> degrees Fahrenheit per minute.

      <solution>
        <p>
            The value <m>F''(30) \approx -0.0516</m>,
            which is measured in degrees Fahrenheit per minute per minute.  
            Along with the other data, this tells us
            that at the moment <m>t = 30</m>,
            the temperature of the potato is <m>167.6</m> degrees,
            that its temperature is rising at a rate of <m>2.065</m> degrees Fahrenheit per minute,
            and that the rate at which the temperature is rising is <em>falling</em>
            at a rate of <m>0.0516</m> degrees Fahrenheit per minute per minute.
            That is, while the temperature is rising,
            it is rising at a slower and slower rate.
            At <m>t = 31</m>, we expect that <m>F(31) \approx 167.6 + 2.065 = 169.7</m> degrees Fahrenheit, 
            and <m>F'(31) \approx 2.065 - 0.0516 = 2.01343</m> degrees Fahrenheit per minute.

      <solution>
        <p>
            On the interval <m>[10,40]</m>, the potato's temperature increasing at a decreasing rate because the values of the first derivative of <m>F</m> are falling.

            this is because the value of <m>F''(t)</m> is negative throughout the given time interval.
